# PowerBI-Dashboards

These are dashboards that were created as part of an e-commerce company. The data was pulled from BigQuery, and connected to PowerBI. 
Data cleansing was performed in PowerBI, and with DAX queries, the visuals were produced to show the key metrics and performance of the company on a weekly basis.
